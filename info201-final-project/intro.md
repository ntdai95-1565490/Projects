This data set focuses on the track record of FBI arrests in the United States. The analysis of
the provided set can be extrapolated to find the trends and, vis-a-vis, the progression of crime
can be determined. The collection has been segregated by the different types of crime which include
but are not limited to, homicide, assault, arson, DUI, etc. The chronological frame of reference for 
the analysed data is from 1995 to 2016. 

Our analysis helped us answer a few questions (as mentioned below)  we had about the overall progression of national
arrest data in all the three tenses: past, present, and future.

- How have national arrest trends changed from 1995 through 2016? What do these trends say about
    our national crimes?
- How do arrest trends differ state-wise through the progression of time?
- To what extent does the progression of age show a continuous trend for crimes committed by a single individual?
- How do drinking under the influence (DUI) arrests differ from the rates of various types of
  thefts in the US?

## Conclusion

When we tried to answer our queries about crime rates in the US and state levels, surprisingly, many trends and progressions of arrests got revealed. We looked at the progressions of crime from 1995 through 2016 in different areas of crime: violent crime, property crime, homicide, arson, DUI, theft,  forgery, fraud, and rape. These crime have been tracked by the FBI crime database.

In our "Types of Crimes by State" tab we looked into the kinds of different crimes on a state level. This tab analyzed state statistics from 1995 to 2016. This data showed that property crime rates were the highest and the homicide crime rates were the lowest on average in the US. This goes against social stereotype and levels of public awareness. Society places emphasis on homicide, showing it prominently in the media. However this type of crime on average is one of the lowest. Property crime on the other hand does not get a lot of media attention and makes up the most arrests in the US.

Another question that was looked into was, how age affects crime and how juvenile and adult crimes change over time in the US. In our "Comparison in Juveniles and Adults Crime" tab we used data from juvenile arrests and overall adult arrests to analyze how age factors into crime. For example, when looking at how arson rates have changed from 1994 to 2016 we can see that adults do the majority of crimes in the US overall. However, we also found that the time when adults in 2016 were juveniles. The arrests of juveniles compared to any other year were more and when those juveniles became adults they were behind all those crimes. This leads to the conclusion that if we curb juvenile rates of crime we can decrease adult crime, which has actually happened in most of the plots. The graph shows how juveniles can often continue into adult crime, so by placing more attention on juvenile crime we can decrease overall crime rates.

Then we went on to a question where we became specific, we compared DUI against the theft crimes in US and tried to form a correlation between them. In that plot we see that rates of DUI and Larceny almost coincide thus giving us a point that the two are related to each and if we try to control one we can control the other. The overall trend of the plot tended to decrease showing how these crimes have been dealt together as we see all these crimes going down

Thus, the overall crime from 1995 to 2016 has gradually declined. This goes against a popular opinion that crime has increased throughout time. The graph shows that each year all forms of crime have declined, despite a slight increase in the mid-2000's. This could be attributed to the economic crisis, population growth, or various other factors that influence crime in the US.
